# strich-vue2-sample

This repository shows to integrate STRICH SDK in a Vue 2.x project.

You need a valid license key to run this sample. To get started with STRICH SDK, check out
the [Getting Started](https://docs.strich.io/getting-started.html) guide.

## Running the Sample

```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

This will start the local development server and make the app available under the URL
`https://localhost:4173` or `https://<your IP address>:4173`. As camera access is required,
the app is served via HTTPS using `@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl`
(see: https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-basic-ssl).
